# Overview table R packages {#tablepkgs}

We summarize various `R` packages (ordered alphabetically) to 
create production-ready tables in clinical research. 
The list is by no means complete; if you know another package that has been useful for you to
create tables or listing using clinical trial data. 
Please contribute to this chapter.

## `flextable`

The `flextable` ([website](https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/))
package provides a *grammar* for creating and customizing tables. 
The following output formats are supported: 

  - 'Word' (`*.docx`), 
  - 'PowerPoint' (`*.pptx`), 
  - 'PDF'
  - 'HTML'. 
  
The syntax to create table is the same 
for the user regardless of the type of output to be produced. 
A set of functions allows the creation, definition of cell
arrangement, addition of headers, formatting and definition of cell content
(i.e. text and or images). 
The package also offers a set of high-level functions
that allow, for example, tabular reporting of statistical models and the
creation of complex cross tabulations.

## `gt`

The `gt` ([website](https://gt.rstudio.com/)) package provides
a high-level and declarative interface for composing tables. 
Contains a variety of `formatter` functions for transforming cell values
from an input data frame to the desired reporting values (combines mutation and
aesthetic styling with options for: scientific notation, uncertainty, ranges,
percentages, suffixes, localized currency, etc.). Multiple output formats are
supported with the same declarative interface (e.g., HTML, LaTeX/PDF, and RTF).

## `r2rtf`

The `r2rtf` ([website](https://merck.github.io/r2rtf/)) package 
creates production-ready tables and figures in RTF format. 
The R package is designed to

- provide simple “verb” functions that correspond to each component of a table, to help you translate data frame(s) to a table in RTF file.
- enables pipes (%>%).
- only focus on table format.
- Data manipulation and analysis 
shall be handled by other R packages. (e.g., tidyverse)
minimizes package dependency

Chapter 1-9 of [The R for Clinical Study Reports and Submission](https://r4csr.org/) book 
provides examples by using `r2rtf` package. 

## `rtables`

The `rtables` package defines a pipe-able grammar for declaring complex table
structure layouts via nested splitting - in row- and column-space - and the
specification of analysis functions which will calculate cell values within that
structure. These pre-data table layouts are then applied to data to build the
table, during which all necessary data grouping implied by the row and column
splits, cell value calculation, and tabulation occurs automatically. Additional
table features such as titles, footers, and referential footnotes are supported.
ASCII, HTML, and PDF are supported as output formats for rendering tables.

`rtables` source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/roche/rtables) as well
as the [documentation](https://roche.github.io/rtables/). `rtables` is also available
on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rtables).
