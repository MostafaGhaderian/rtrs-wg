### R Tables for Regulatory Submissions Working Group
https://github.com/RConsortium/rtrs-wg

The R Consortium working group, R Tables for Regulatory Submissions  (RTRS) includes representation from several large pharmaceutical companies and CROâ€™s. The goal of the working group is to create standards for creating tables that meet the requirements of FDA submission documents, and hence enhance the suitability of R for FDA submissions. It is part of a larger R Consortium effort to facilitate the certification and validation of R packages and tools for FDA submissions thereby allowing drug developers to submit documentation for regulatory approval using the R programming environment in conjunction with open-source packages without the need for closed and often expensive proprietary tools.


### Discussions

Let's talk about working group goals, work in progress, challenges and ideas in discussions. It's a great place to ask questions about buiding tables and documents for clinical trial submissions, discuss some ideas, engage with others, and much more!
