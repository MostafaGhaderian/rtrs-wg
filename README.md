The R Consortium working group, R Tables for Regulatory Submissions  (RTRS) includes representation from several large pharmaceutical companies and CROâ€™s. The goal of the working group is to create standards for creating tables that meet the requirements of FDA submission documents, and hence enhance the suitability of R for FDA submissions. It is part of a larger R Consortium effort to facilitate the certification and validation of R packages and tools for FDA submissions thereby allowing drug developers to submit documentation for regulatory approval using the R programming environment in conjunction with open-source packages without the need for closed and often expensive proprietary tools.
