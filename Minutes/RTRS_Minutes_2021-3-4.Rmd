Joe Rickert began the meeting and suggested the following agenda:

1. Discussion of requirements document
2. Discussion about `rtables` which is now on CRAN
3. Workflows discussion

Adrian Waddell presented the rtables package by showing examples, and provided a walk through of the code for table generation. Note that all but the very beginning of Adrian's presentation was recorded. The link is below. Some key points:

* `rtables` still needs to add title and footnotes support and other formatting features to be ready for making regulatory filings. 
* Used data from `random.cdisc.data` which may be open-sourced by Roche soon
* Adrian demonstrated the rtables API with the CDISC data sample
* The building of analysis functions is key to effectively creating table layouts
* Once a table is built, you can do post-processing (and one of the operations is pruning values)
* The table_structure() function provides the table AST and it uses the CDISC terminology; full paths to the data are revealed, allowing for setting and getting (e.g., value_at())
* Adrian showed the `tern` package which is a Roche proprietary package that supports `rtables`
    
Joe noted that `tern` is proprietary and asked where the boundary between open-source table creation and proprietary, closed-source functions for tabulation?

Adrian replied that `tern` project (internal package at Roche that supports rtables) is a large focus in the company (with dedicated resources working on it); two-stage approach: (1) find collaborators to help with development, (2) release only when absolutely sure it is ready for public consumption

Michael Kane noted that keeping a package proprietary has more to do with risk-management than profit-based (e.g., software that is open-sourced is perceived to be of poor quality, reflecting on the company brand)

Adrian noted that the development of table software to be a competitive advantage (accelerates review times since it reduces table development time but suggested that he sees very little proprietary-ness in the future of rtables

Phil Bowsher called attention to that threat that large companies could bundle `rtables` into their proprietary cloud offerings.

Paulo Bargo affirmed that collaboration on coding tables for regulators means that everyone could benefit (companies and regulators).

This initiated a lengthy discussion on collaboration. Both Adrian and Paulo suggested that it might be possible for developers from their respective companies to work jointly to further develop `rtables`. Everyone seemed to agree that company safeguards, legal considerations and other practical considerations could be worked out.

Joe pointed out at less tightly integrated collaboration was still very important and suggested every one would benefit from building out the [requirements document](https://github.com/RConsortium/rtrs-wg/blob/main/Requirements/working-requirements/requirements.md).

Joe suggested that the group consider
* documenting workflows in which the table generating software would be used
* building out the requirements document to reflect these workflows
* creating a document that compares the different table-making packages

The meeting adjourned a little over an hour after starting.
The next meeting is scheduled for 9AM Pacific Time on April 1, 2021
