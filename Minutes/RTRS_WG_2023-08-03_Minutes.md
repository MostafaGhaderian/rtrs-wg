### Publication of ebook in R Consortium Website

* Publication has been delayed because the rendering of the ebook in WordPress is of poor quality.
* The long term solution is to redo the RC website to accept markdown and Quarto documents.
* In the short term, we would like to add a branch to the GitHub repo that would display the published document independently of the development version. The RC website will then point to this link.
* See issue [#140](https://github.com/RConsortium/rtrs-wg/issues/140).

**Action:** 

* David Gohel has been asked to update the GitHub repo to accommodate the published version of the ebook.


### Conference Talks and ebook promotion

The group discussed 2023 opportunities to speak about the ebook. Possibilities include:

* [posit::conf](https://posit.co/conference/) (Sept 17 - 20)

**Actions:** 

* Alex will write the abstract for a talk about the RTRS ebook at R/Pharma . Note that the abstract is due on August 11th. This talk will focus on the ebook.
* Gabe will submit an abstract to R/Pharma that concentrates on making tables.
* JBR will contact Applied Epi to investigate opportunities to promote the ebook to epidemiologists.
* JBR will contact PHUSE leaders to explore additional opportunities to promote the ebook.


### Future Work

* The group began a discussion of what topics to include in version 2 of the ebook, and will continue the discussion at the next meeting.
* See issue [#139](https://github.com/RConsortium/rtrs-wg/issues/139)
* There was some discussion about how the [TLG Catalog](https://insightsengineering.github.io/tlg-catalog/) fits with the goals of the working group and the ebook. The general agreement was that the ebook should present table archetypes or shapes of tables that describe all of the relevant table types that are found in clinical submissions. We are not aiming for a complete list of tables. 
* The WG is interested in adding two types of tables to the ebook.
  * Tables from the TLG that represent a new archetype not already included in the ebook
  * Tables that actually conform to one of the archetypes in the ebook, but look sufficiently different from the examples given in the ebook that conformity to the archetype may not be obvious.
 
The next meeting of the RTRS WG will be at 9AM PST on September 7, 20023.
