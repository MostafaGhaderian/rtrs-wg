Joseph Rickert brought the meeting to order.
Mike Kane noted that the RTRS WG repo has been updated with an opened up Discussions section.

Mike Stackhouse presented an overview of the pharmaRTF package:

* Goal was to replicate a CSR table using CDISC data (CDSIC Pilot Replication in R). 
* Writing to RTF does nicely replicate the regulatory reference doc
* The header and footer present challenges: ideal situation is to have the table header and footer in the documentâ€™s header and footer (allowing for repeating across pages)
* There was some discussion about how RTF and style of formatting is largely governed by processes in Pharma companies rather than a requirement from regulatory bodies

Michael Kane
* two areas of attention: (1) reproduce formatting/layout in document, (2) integration with other table packages

Michael Stackhouse
* suggested Atorus and RStudio to make table packages work together more nicely
* asked if there might be interested in a formal, language-free specification for tables

Adrian Waddell did a  walkthrough of the requirements from his pull request which was merged into the requirements document discussing how they relate to the rtables package .
 * Rounding of numbers became a point of discussion (should it be an option? What should the default be?)


Joseph Rickert suggested that we add the following discussion topics to the repo to help shape our short term objectives and work product

* Address the issue identified by Mike Stackhouse that some believe CDISC compliant tables cannot be generated in R by providing an example of doing so and publicizing it. (Maybe in a blog)
* Continue to build out the requirements document and consider whether its
focus needs to be narrowed to a particular area of Pharma e.g. clinical, or Phase 2 and 3 trials etc
* Continue to explore features of the existing table generation packages and explain how and to what extent they work together
* Explore making a CRAN task view for R packages that generate summary tables.
